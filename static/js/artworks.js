    description: 'DO NOT TOUCH! deals with the human relationship with planet earth. For centuries, humans have invoked a new geochronological epoque: the anthropocene. It defines the epoque in which the human hand makes the most significant impact on the overall biolgical, geological and athmospheric processes on the planet. DO NOT TOUCH! invites the viewer to touch the planet and feel humanities potential impact on it. In times of the global crisis it is evident that the world is literally melting away, by the human-hand.  ',

            'I felt in order to project the contrasts in our humanity and to expose the Underbelly of what is actually happening in the word.It was important to first start with where we are. The first scene sets the tone with what we as people are subjected to on a daily basis which is news headlines, protests and the mind numbing media we find ourselves watching relentlessly. As the track begins to narrate the story by sound bytes from Greta Thunberg. Her first words “This is all wrong” immediately impacts the listener by stating that morality is far from normal. During the scenes I emphasised pollution during the phrase “Blah Blah Blah”. Since we as a society have chosen to ignore issues and destructive behaviour by our own it seems fitting to put both the tragic elements to the world alongside this phrase of ignorance. The main Bridge however does display array of hope as stated and to do this I interjected images of hardship with those who choose to change the world. This who have decided that their humanity is dependent on change. This followed by a media conglomerate of news narrative , conference speeches and over dubbed speeches from politicians felt fitting and also confusing. In fact it explores the phrase that great screened at the climate summit “empty words and promises”. The end is a poignant reminder that all is not lost and with free standing words floating to her last comment “Change is coming.” Leaves both the viewer and listener hanging onto these words as a reminder and as a baton to be passed towards them for change. The Track itself Created by YENNER in Summer  of 2020, the sound and melody was one that needed something important. The violins represented a harrowing nature and coincided with a hopeful melodic tone. Whilst creating this piece I had been privy to news and headlines and took more insight into the subject climate change as an oxymoron almost. Both a tormenting display of where the world is ending but a scripted narrative of false hope. It was this that immediately gave me the idea for adding Greta’s speeches collages across the track that would add impact and would enable me as an artist to provide commentary through expression. Since her speech contained both hope and heartache it was a jigsaw puzzle that effortlessly fit and the outcome became both one of education and musical beauty.',
