# Climate Art Taskforce
The climate art taskforce (CAT) is a global alliance of interdisciplinary digital artists against climate change. Based on an open source platform, CAT curates and publishes digital artworks & publications making climate change accessible and approachable for a non-expert audience. CAT invites digital practitioners to contribute with their own relating digital works.

With itâ€™s open source approach, CAT aims to be inclusive towards all kinds of artists and art formats relating to climate change, everyone is welcome to contribute. Selected artworks and the platform itself are constantly curated for external projects and campaigns.

# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000

## Environment
Rename `.env.example` to `.env` in the main folder and provide your `appId` and `serverUrl` from Moralis ([How to start Moralis Server](https://docs.moralis.io/moralis-server/getting-started/create-a-moralis-server))

```

Deploy `NFT` and `MarketPlace` contracts present in the contracts folder on any local blockchain created using for example [Ganache](https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/) or to any public blockchains for example `Mumbai Testnet` using [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) or [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/) etc.

Create contractsData folder in the root directory and add following 2 JSON files onto it:

- NFT-address.json / NFT-address.json : Contains address of the deployed contract
```json
  {
    "address": 
  }
```
